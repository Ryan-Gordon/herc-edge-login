# useful terminal commands like grepping and find

Tools you'll need: android studio SDK and genymotion.
1. In terminal, run 'adb'. If it works, then you've got androids SDK on the right path. Otherwise, you gotta follow expo docs to install genymotion.
2. in the terminal, run 'exp'. If it works, then you've got expo. Other wise, you gotta npm install -g exp.
3. In the temrinal, at project root, run 'yarn install' to install dependencies.
